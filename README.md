# Xerox Page Builder

Visit the [App](https://soumodip.github.io/xerox-page-builder/) here

It's very hard to generate an optimum page for xerox printouts these days.
Overall there are 2 major problems, if you are a student: 
- Pages needs to be merged i.e. students need 4 or more pages to be converted into a single page.
- Ed Tech firms use black boards, and provide notes as a screenshot. Printout cost of those notes are high as its darker which needs more ink through out the page. Those pages needs to be converted into white i.e. inverting the page colors.

Xerox Page Builder solves these 2 problems, and provides:
- Conversion of Black Pages to White background i.e. Color invert
- Merging of multiple pages into single page.

I actually built this app back in 2022, but Mozilla removed few files from their own server to github. We are now using Nuxt 3+ in 2024, so I thought to rewrite a bit of it again and host it locally.
