Its very hard to generate an optimum page for xerox printout these days.
Overall there are 2 major problem that we have identified: 
- Pages needs to be merged i.e. students need 4 or more pages to be converted into a single page.
- Ed Tech firms use black boards, and provide notes as a screenshot. Printout cost of those notes are hight as its colored with black through out the page. Those pages needs to be converted into white i.e. inverting the page colors.

Xerox Page Builder solves those 2 problems, and provides:
- Conversion of Black Pages to White background i.e. Color invert
- Merging of multiple pages into single page.
